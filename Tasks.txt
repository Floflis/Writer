- save using .sh instead of Electron

- Character count
- Character limit advisor (Twitter, Twitter old, ETH, NFC chp)

- button to switch when writing md
- works both on Desktop and Mobile

- Addons at UniStore (they add menu items and perform .sh actions such as posting your text)
- Share buttons (Tweet)
- add timestamp
- tabs lib that can select multiple tabs to move and tab grouping (davidExplorer, Internet Cat, Eventlr)

- after a "ctrl + z" error from my mom, through this she gave me this idea: non-linear text edition history. Even if you accidentaly overwrite a text and instead of noticing & ctrl + z you write after, you could still recover (this idea matches the philosophy of the Pijul VCS. Sound ctrl + z!)
